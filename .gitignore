# NOTE: Notebook OUTPUT CELLS often bloat repos and make diffs hard.
# Consider using a tool like `nbstripout` to automatically clear output before committing.
# Installation: pip install nbstripout
# Setup (run in repo): nbstripout --install
# If you want to *never* commit notebooks (uncommon), uncomment below:
# *.ipynb

# HTML / PDF / Other output formats generated from notebooks (if not needed in repo)
# *.html
# *.pdf
# Be cautious if you have legitimate source HTML/PDF files you *do* want to commit.

# --- Data Files ---
# It's best practice to store large data files outside Git (e.g., S3, GCS, network drive).
# Ignore common data directories and file extensions often used for large data.
data/
datasets/
*.csv
*.tsv
*.jsonl
*.parquet
*.pkl
*.pickle
*.h5
*.hdf5
*.feather
*.arrow
*.avro
*.xls
*.xlsx
# If you have *small* data files (e.g., config, small examples) that *should* be tracked,
# you can force-add them (`git add -f path/to/your/small_data.csv`) or make the
# ignore patterns more specific (e.g., `data/*.csv` instead of `*.csv`).

# --- Model Files ---
# Trained models are usually large binary files and shouldn't be in Git.
